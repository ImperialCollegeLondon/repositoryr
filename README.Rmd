The goal of repositoryr is to provide a step by step guide to creating a R package repository.

## Requirements

- RStudio installed: You will need R and RStudio both installed. You can do so either by:
  
  - Download [RStudio Desktop](https://posit.co/downloads/) OR
  - Use [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/) (online) OR
  - Install it via Chocolatey (first install R using `choco install r.project` and then RStudio using `choco install r.studio`) OR 
  - Install it via Homebrew.
  
## Toolchain for building R packages

If you are using RStudio, don't worry about setting this up for now. The IDE will alert you and provide support once you try to do something that requires you to setup your development environment. For example:
  - On Windows, you will need to install [Rtools](https://r-pkgs.org/setup.html#windows).
  - On macOS, you will need to install [Xcode](https://r-pkgs.org/setup.html#macos).
  - On Linux, you will need to install the R development package, called [`r-base-dev`](https://r-pkgs.org/setup.html#linux).

## Selecting a package name

Install the package `available` in RStudio using `install.packages("available")`. To find suggestions on valid package names use `available::suggest(text="description of what the package does")`. You can also check whether the package name is available using `available::available("pkgname")`.

Alternatively, you can use `pak::pkg_name_check("healthgpsrvis", dictionaries = NULL)`. (Note: To install `pak`, use `install.packages("pak")`).

## Creating a package

- In RStudio go to File -> New Project -> New Directory -> R Package. 
- Write the name of the package and select using renv and initialise git. 
- This will create a minimal package structure. 

## Create and connect with a GitHub repository

- Create a new repository on GitHub using the same name as the package. 
- Set the visibility permissions of this repository as suitable but DO NOT initialise this repository with anything. 
- Copy a clone URL of the repository to your clipboard.

More details: [Create and connect a GitHub repo](https://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-last.html#create-and-connect-a-github-repo-without-usethis)

## Connect local repo to GitHub repo

- Click on the “two purple boxes and a white square” in the Git pane. 
- Click “Add remote”. 
- Paste the GitHub repo’s URL here and pick a remote name, say, `origin` and click “Add”.
- Enter main as the branch name and make sure “Sync branch with remote” is checked and click “Create”.

## Connect local repo to GitHub repo with the command line

- In a shell, run the following (substituting with your URL):

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/repositoryr
git push --set-upstream origin main
```

- You should now be able to see all the project files you committed on the GitHub repo browser.


## Using `devtools`

- Install devtools in RStudio using `install.packages("devtools")`.
- It is a set of packages that support various aspects of package development (it includes the `usethis` package too).

## Using `devtools::check()`

- At this stage, you can try `devtools::check()` to see if there are any issues with the package.
- If any of the toolchain required to build an R package is missing in your system, then RStudio will alert you at this stage. Please refer [Toolchain for building R packages](#Toolchain-for-building-R-packages) and once done run `devtools::check()` again. It should raise an issue about missing/non-standard license in the `DESCRIPTION` file (This issue will be fixed soon!).

## Update `DESCRIPTION` file

- The `DESCRIPTION` file contains the metadata of your package. You can add some descriptive text about your package under `Title` and `Description` fields. You can also fill in the author and maintainer details. 
- Manually add BSD-3-Clause license (recommended) first to your repository and then to the `DESCRIPTION` file.
- Run `devtools::check()` to verify if everything works (As of now, it raises a note "Licence stub is invalid DCF.")

## Build a README

- Use `usethis::use_readme_rmd()` to initialize a basic, executable `README.Rmd` file. 
- In the `README.Rmd` you can add the purpose of the package, provide installation instructions, and show an example of how the package can be used.
- Remember to render the `README.Rmd` file (each time that you make a change to it) to make the `README.md` file. You can do this by running `devtools::build_readme()`.

## Add R files and corresponding unit tests

- Create a R function file using `usethis::use_r("filename")`.
- A `filename.R` file will be created under the `R/` directory which you can populate.
- Create a corresponding unit test file using `usethis::use_test("filename")`.
- A `test-filename.R` file will be created under the `tests/testthat/` directory where you can add the unit tests.

## Setup documentation

- Use `devtools::document` to set up the documentation for your package. 
- Delete the template `R/hello.R` file.
- Now open any other R file (that you created) where you want add the documentation (here it is, the `R/add.R` file).
- Put the cursor somewhere in the function definition. Then do, `Code > Insert roxygen skeleton`. A comment structure should appear above your function, in which each line begins with #'. 
- Edit the comments suitably. If a `NAMESPACE` file already exists, please delete it so that it can be automatically generated by `roxygen2`. To do so, run `devtools::document()` this will also create the corresponding `filename.Rd` file in `man/filename.Rd` using `roxygen2`.

## Create website for your package

- Run `install.packages("pkgdown")`.
- To configure the package to use and deploy pkgdown, run `usethis::use_pkgdown_github_pages()`.
- To preview your site locally before publishing, run `pkgdown::build_site()`.
- This will add the necessary components and sets up GitHub Actions for automatic site building when deploying. 
- Your `README.md` becomes the homepage, documentation in `man/` generates a function reference, and vignettes will be rendered into `articles/`.

## Bonus!

- Add a GitHub action workflow to render Rmarkdown using `usethis::use_github_action("render-rmarkdown")`.
- Add another action to lint your package using `usethis::use_github_action("lint")`.
- Add a `R CMD-check` badge using `usethis::use_github_actions_badge()`.
- Customise the package website by editing the `_pkgdown.yml` file. For example, you can add a lightswitch and GitHub repository button to the navbar:

```yaml
template:
  bootstrap: 5
  light-switch: true
navbar:
  structure:
    right: [search, github, lightswitch]
  components:
    github:
      icon: fa-github
      href: https://github.com/<owner-name>/<repo-name>
      aria-label: GitHub
```

## Installation

You can install the development version of repositoryr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("ImperialCollegeLondon/repositoryr")
```
